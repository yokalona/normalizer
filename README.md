# normalizer
Normalizes audio in folder and subfolders

Sets target LUFS level to an audio track, a percieved loudness level. Default level is -12.0 LUFS

Only tested on *.mp3 files, but can be easily expanded to other audio formats. For more complicated formats, like audio-video, it might take some effort to implement, and currently there is no goal in achieving that.
